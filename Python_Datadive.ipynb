    "The data above reinforces that students with higher attendance have higher exam scores. By extending this relationship to teacher quality, this shows that of the students who attend more classes, those with lower-quality teachers have higher exam scores. Contrastingly, of students who attend fewer classes, those with higher quality teachers have higher exam scores. For both attendance groups, students with medium-quality teachers have the lowest average exam scores, even if they attend more classes than others. This is interesting, as the expected result was that for both attendance groups, the average score would increase as the teacher quality improved. These results could be interpreted that students who attend class learn more, resulting in better exam scores. However, students who attend class learn less, and their exam scores suffer as a result. For those who don't attend class, having a higher quality teacher benefits their exam score more than those who do not. It is reasonable to conclude that teacher quality will have a slight impact on a student's exam scores, that impact becoming greater if they attend class less."

    "The data above shows that sleep is related to exam scores. Initially, the results are unexpected. The data shows that students who get less than the recommended amount of sleep have a higher average exam score than those who get the recommended amount. However, by looking closer at the values it is clear that the 4-hour group has a wider range of values than the other two. Its higher score of 82 is a major outlier and likely has skewed the exam score average. As demonstrated below, by excluding the outlier the average drops dramatically. It is also interesting that those who get more than 8 hours of sleep have slightly worse exam scores. This indicates that sleeping too much may be slightly detrimental. Looking at physical activity, for those who get the same or less than the recommended amount, those with the highest grades get no physical activity, followed by a mid-range amount. For those who get more than the recommended amount, the ones with the highest grades get the most, followed by a low amount. It is reasonable to conclude that sleep has a large impact on exam scores, with those getting the recommended amount scoring higher than those who get more or less. It cannot be concluded whether physical activity has a definitive relation to exam scores, as no consistent relationship has been observed."

This could indicate that the presence of a learning disability makes those students have more extreme feelings regarding doing well in school. They could be discouraged and feel less motivated or be encouraged and feel more motivated to do well despite their learning disability. Those without disabilities may not feel less or more motivated because of the lack of that extra factor impacting their learning. It is reasonable to conclude that the presence of a learning disability has a slight impact on a student's motivation level, with the data indicating it could cause them to feel more extreme about doing well than those who do not."
